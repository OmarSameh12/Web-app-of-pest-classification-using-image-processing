1) Dataset: system constructed 27 agricultural common pest
detection data sets
2)Algorithm: algorithm uses
resnet50 as the backbone network, uses Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) to extract features, and optimizes them by
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS). Finally, the method is implemented by
HALCON machine vision software mainly using CNN algorithm to achieve deep learning 
3)Pre-processing steps:preprocessing part is mainly divided into six aspects: 
setting parameters, 
setting input and output paths,
reading and splitting data sets, 
determining model parameters according to data,
creating target detection model and data set preprocessing.
4)Accuracy:average precision of 92.5%
5)Output: system can detect and count the
uploaded pest images, and save the detection results to MySQL
database
